    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!
    team[0] = "Mon";

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person));

    const person3 = Object.assign({}, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person4 = { ...person };

    const innerPerson = {
      name: "Peter Parker",
      age: 24,
      social: {
        facebook: ['Peter123','vownbvo','wovin2o'],
        twitter: 'peter321',
      },
    }

    const person5 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(innerPerson));

    const person6 = Object.assign({}, innerPerson);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
